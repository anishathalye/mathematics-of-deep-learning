# The Mathematics of Deep Learning

The class site is at http://www.anishathalye.com/mathematics-of-deep-learning/

I'll be uploading lecture videos at some point and linking to them from here.
If you're going through the material (slides, notes, and Jupyter notebooks) in
this repository independently, I highly recommend either watching the lecture
videos or reading through the presenter notes while reading the slides.
