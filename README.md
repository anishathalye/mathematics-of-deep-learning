# The Mathematics of Deep Learning:

The class site is http://www.anishathalye.com/mathematics-of-deep-learning/

I'll be uploading lecture videos at some point and linking to them from here.
If you're going through the material (slides, notes, and Jupyter notebooks) in
this repository independently, I highly recommend either watching the lecture
videos or reading through the presenter notes while reading the slides.

## Outline:

* Introduction (`00-xx`)
* Key ideas, part 1 (`01-xx`)
    * Program search
    * Gradient descent
    * Computational graphs
    * Backpropagation
* Key ideas, part 2 (`02-xx`)
    * Search spaces
* Hands-on (`03-xx`)
    * Adversarial examples
    * Transfer learning
